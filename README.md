# LogGuard
LogGuard is a state-of-the-art machine learning programme that will 
transform incident detection through seamless log scanning. The sheer amount of data 
generated in today's complicated digital ecosystem makes finding and resolving 
incidents a difficult task. My creative solution offers a proactive and quick method of 
incident identification by utilising machine learning algorithms to analyse logs 
effectively. My programme improves cybersecurity measures and gives organisations 
the ability to keep ahead of potential threats by utilising advanced pattern recognition 
and anomaly detection.
